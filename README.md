# Video.js Html5 Dash

VideoJS source handler for the MPEG-DASH Adaptive Dynamic Streaming Standard in HTML5

## Getting Started

Once you've added the source handler script to your page, it should automatically pick up supported source types:

```html
<script src="video.js"></script>
<script src="videojs-html5-dash.js"></script>
```

There's also a [working example](example.html) of the source handler you can check out if you're having trouble.
